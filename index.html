                        <h3>The Beginning 1789</h3>
                        <p>
                                The history of electro-chemical energy storage began with scientific investigations into
                                electricity. Names such as Luigi Galvani (1737-1798) and Alessandro Volta (1745-1827) are
                                associated with this work and live on today in terms such as “galvanic cell” and “volt”. In
                                1789, while conducting an experiment, Galvani noticed that the legs of a frog began to
                                twitch when they came into contact with two different types of metal. He concluded there
                                
                                was a connection between electricity and muscle activity
                                
                                .Ten years later, Volta constructed the first simple battery. He put together alternating discs
                                of copper and zinc in a column, with a sheet of paper soaked in a salt solution inserted
                                between each of the layers. The “Vol-taic pile” produced electricity when the plates were
                                connected together with wire. Higher voltage could be extracted when several piles were
                                
                                connected in series.<br>

                               Rechargeable batteries (also known as secondary batteries, accumulators or accu packs)
                               allow spent chemical energy to be restored by recharging. A recharger device pumps
                               electrons from the plus pole back to the minus pole. This recharges and reacti-vates the
                               electrode mass. The discharge/recharge process can be repeated up to a thousand times.

                                Primary batteries can only be discharged once

                                    Primary batteries are batteries that <span>cannot be recharged once depleted</span>. Primary batteries are made of electrochemical cells whose electrochemical reaction cannot be reversed
                                    Primary batteries exist in different forms ranging from <span>coin cells to AA batteries</span>. They are commonly used in standalone applications where charging is impractical or impossible. A good example of which is in military grade devices and battery powered equipment. It will be impractical to use rechargeable batteries as recharging a battery will be the last thing in the mind of the soldiers. Primary batteries always have high specific energy and the systems in which they are used are always designed to consume low amount of power to enable the battery last as long as possible.

                                    The most popular type of primary batteries are <span>alkaline batteries</span>. They have a high specific energy and are environmentally friendly, cost-effective and do not leak even when fully discharged. They can be stored for several years, have a good safety record and can be carried on an aircraft without being subject to UN Transport and other regulations. The only downside to alkaline batteries is the low load current, which limits its use to devices with low current requirements like remote controls, flashlights and portable entertainment devices.

                                    Secondary batteries are batteries with electrochemical cells whose chemical reactions can be reversed by applying a certain voltage to the battery in the reversed direction. Also referred to as rechargeable batteries, secondary cells unlike primary cells can be recharged after the energy on the battery has been used up.

                                    They are typically used in high drain applications and other scenarios where it will be either too expensive or impracticable to use single charge batteries. Small capacity secondary batteries are used to power portable electronic devices like mobile phones, and other gadgets and appliances while heavy-duty batteries are used in powering diverse electric vehicles and other high drain applications like load levelling in electricity generation. They are also used as standalone power sources alongside Inverters to supply electricity. Although the initial cost of acquiring rechargeable batteries is always a whole lot higher than that of primary batteries but they are the most cost-effective over the long-term.                                                                                                                                        
                                    
                                    Secondary batteries can be further classified into several other types based on their chemistry. This is very important because the chemistry determines some of the attributes of the battery including its specific energy, cycle life, shelf life, and price to mention a few.
